# Makerspace-Projects
 These are the files which were made for my local Makerspace, either personal projects or projects relating to Makerspace assets.
 
## Kill Team Game Board (P)
Multi-layer Kill Team incorporating an urban setting (like Necromunda) and an underground level (like Space Hulk) allows for multi-vector and immersive gameplay.
 
## CNC Machine (M)
Upgrades for Shapeoko 2 CNC Machine to accomodate wider footprint and cutting volume (1000x1000x500) with a Makita RT701C Router. Also includes files for the dust extraction system.
